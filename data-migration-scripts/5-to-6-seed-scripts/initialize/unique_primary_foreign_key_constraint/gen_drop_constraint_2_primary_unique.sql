-- Generate a script to drop unique/primary key constraints.

-- For upgrades from 5X we need to set gp_enable_drop_key_constraint_child_partition so we can drop unique and primary
-- key constraints directly from leaf partitions, in addition to dropping them from the root. Normally, dropping
-- constraints directly from leaves is banned by GPDB - and dropping constraints from the root suffices. However,
-- dropping such constraints from the root doesn't always drop the constraint from the leaves (if an unnamed constraint
-- was added to the partition hierarchy with ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT at the root level).

-- For upgrades from 6X onwards, it is sufficient to drop the constraint from the root level.
