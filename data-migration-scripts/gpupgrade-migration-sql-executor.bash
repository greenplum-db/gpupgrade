Executes scripts addressing catalog inconsistencies between Greenplum versions.
Before running this command, run gpupgrade-migration-sql-generator.bash.
This command should be run only during the downtime window.

Usage: '$(basename $0)' <GPHOME> <PGPORT> <INPUT_DIR>
     <GPHOME>    : the path to the source Greenplum installation directory
     <PGPORT>    : the source Greenplum system port number
     <INPUT_DIR> : the directory containing the scripts to execute. This is the
                   <OUTPUT_DIR> you specified earlier in gpupgrade-migration-sql-generator.bash,
                   with a subdirectory appended as in the use cases below. The
                   subdirectories are pre-initialize, post-finalize, and post-revert.

Use cases:
- Before "gpupgrade initialize", drop and alter objects:
gpupgrade-migration-sql-executor.bash /path/to/gphome 5432 /path/to/output_dir/pre-initialize

- Following "gpupgrade finalize", restore and recreate objects:
gpupgrade-migration-sql-executor.bash /path/to/gphome 5432 /path/to/output_dir/post-finalize

- Following "gpupgrade revert", restore objects:
gpupgrade-migration-sql-executor.bash /path/to/gphome 5432 /path/to/output_dir/post-revert

Log files can be found in INPUT_DIR/data_migration.log'
