You are about to initialize a major-version upgrade of Greenplum.

gpupgrade initialize will perform a series of steps, including:
 - Check disk space
 - Create the target cluster
 - Run pg_upgrade consistency checks

gpupgrade log files can be found on all hosts in %s

gpupgrade initialize will use these values from %s
source_master_port:   %d
source_gphome:        %s
target_gphome:        %s
mode:                 %s
disk_free_ratio:      %.1f
use_hba_hostnames:    %t
dynamic_library_path: %s
temp_port_range:      %s
hub_port:             %d
agent_port:           %d

You will still have the opportunity to revert the cluster to its original state 
after this step.

WARNING: Do not perform operations on the cluster until gpupgrade is 
finalized or reverted.

Before proceeding, ensure the following have occurred:
 - Take a backup of the source Greenplum cluster
 - Generate and execute the data migration "initialize" scripts
 - Run gpcheckcat to ensure the source catalog has no inconsistencies
 - Run gpstate -e to ensure the source cluster's segments are up and in preferred roles

WARNING
_______
The source cluster does not have standby and/or mirrors and 
is being upgraded in link mode.

Once "gpupgrade execute" has started, there will be no way to
return the cluster to its original state using "gpupgrade revert".

If you do not already have a backup, we strongly recommend that
you run "gpupgrade revert" now and take a backup of the cluster.
