# Parameters commented out below are default values.


# The path to the binary directory for the source Greenplum installation.
# For example, /usr/local/<source-greenplum-version>/bin.
# This parameter is required.

# The path to the binary directory for the target Greenplum installation.
# For example, /usr/local/<target-greenplum-version>/bin.
# This parameter is required.

# The mode is the upgrade method. The choices are “link” or “copy”.
# The copy method creates a copy of the primary segments and performs the
# upgrade on the copies.
# The link method directly upgrades the primary segments.
# mode = copy


# The disk free ratio specifies what fraction of disk space must be free on
# every host in order for gpupgrade to run. The ratio ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.
# Recommended values are 0.6 [60%] for copy mode, and 0.2 [20%] for link mode.
# disk_free_ratio = 0.6


# The master port for the source Greenplum installation.
# source_master_port = 5432


# The temporary port range for the target Greenplum installation.
# The temporary port range should be reserved prior to initializaton.
# The format is a comma separated list of ports and port ranges, e.g.
# “6000,6002-6005,6012.” The ports will be reconfigured to use the source
# Greenplum installation port range once upgrade is complete.
# temp_port_range = 50432-65535


# The port where the gpupgrade process will be running.
# hub_port = 7527


# The port where the agent process will be running on all hosts.
# agent_port = 6416
